        <h2>A complete guide to the Japan rail pass!</h2>
        <p>
            Japan is one of my favorite countries in the world. 
            The serene beauty of the mountains and temples, the hustle and bustle of the sprawling cities, the exquisite food, and its long history make for a fascinating place to visit.
            Yet one aspect of traveling in Japan that does live up to its costly reputation is transportation — particularly train travel.
            Japan's iconic bullet trains (called shinkansen) are beautiful, comfortable, convenient, and fast.
            They are world-class wonders of transportation, racing around at speeds up to 320 kilometers (200 miles) per hour.
            They run on special tracks separate from the other trains and are an impressive feat of engineering.

        <h3>What is the Japan Rail Pass?</h3>
        <p>
            The Japan Rail Pass (also known as the JR Pass) was created to help travelers get around the country (similar to the Eurail pass in Europe).
            JR is the largest train operator in Japan, and the pass provides unlimited access to all its trains for a set price.
            The JR Pass needs to be purchased before you arrive in Japan and it has to be mailed to you so you'll want to order it well in advance (more below).
            The JR Pass is very easy to use — you just need to remember to purchase it beforehand, while in your home country, as the pass is only available to visitors.While you can purchase it at select ticket offices in Japan until March 2023, 
            in-person passes cost significantly more, so it's better just to order it in advance.
        </p> 
        
        <p>You can buy JR passes for three regions:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>JR East</li>
            <li>JR West</li>
            <li>JR Central</li>
          </ul>

        <p>In sum, to get a pass, you need to:</p> 

          <ol>
            <li>Pick the time duration for your pass </li>
            <li>Choose your class</li>
            <li>Pay the fee and order the pass before you leave home</li>

          </ol>
